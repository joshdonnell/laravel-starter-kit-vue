An end-to-end type-safe Laravel 13 starter kit with auto-generated TypeScript types, Vue 3, and shadcn-vue components for fast front-end prototyping. Built on top of [Nuno Maduro's Laravel Starter Kit](https://github.com/nunomaduro/laravel-starter-kit-inertia-vue), this kit extends it with Wayfinder, Laravel Data, and unplugin-auto-import to provide a Nuxt-like developer experience when writing Vue code within a Laravel Inertia application.

## Tech Stack

**Backend:** PHP 8.4+, Laravel 13, Inertia.js v3, Laravel Fortify, Spatie Laravel Data, Nuno Maduro's Essentials

**Frontend:** Vue 3, reka-ui, shadcn-vue, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4

**Type Generation:** Laravel Wayfinder (auto-generated route & action types), Spatie Laravel Data + TypeScript Transformer (auto-generated DTO types)

**DX Tooling:** Vite Plus, unplugin-auto-import, unplugin-vue-components, vite-plugin-watch

**Code Quality:** PHPStan (level max via Larastan), Rector, Pint, oxlint, oxfmt, Pest v5 (100% coverage)

## Features

- **Fully type-safe end-to-end** — Auto-generated TypeScript types for routes, actions, and Data Transfer Objects
- **Zero-config auto imports** — Vue APIs, composables, and components are auto-imported just like Nuxt
- **Auto-regenerating types** — Editing `app/Data` or `app/Enums` automatically triggers TypeScript type generation
- **Dark mode & appearance switching** — Built-in theme support with cookie-based persistence
- **Persistent sidebar state** — Collapsible sidebar remembers its state across requests
- **Complete authentication** — Login, registration, password reset, email verification, and two-factor authentication via Laravel Fortify
- **Action-oriented architecture** — Business logic lives in dedicated, immutable Action classes
- **Resource-based routing** — Controllers follow CRUD conventions (Cruddy by Design)
- **Preloaded assets** — Critical CSS and JS are automatically preloaded via Link headers

## Local Development

> **Requires [PHP 8.4+](https://php.net/releases/), [Node 22+](https://nodejs.org/), [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (used in CI), and a code coverage driver like [Xdebug](https://xdebug.org/docs/install).**
>
> SQLite is used by default for database, session, cache, and queue storage.

### Installation

```bash
composer create-project joshdonnell/laravel-starter-kit-vue --prefer-dist example-app
cd example-app
```

### Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies, create .env, generate key, run migrations, and build assets
composer setup

# Start the development server (Laravel, queue, logs, and Vite)
composer dev
```

### Optional: Browser Testing

If you plan to use Pest's browser testing capabilities:

```bash
pnpm add playwright && pnpm exec playwright install
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
composer test
```

You should see 100% test coverage and all quality checks passing.

## Available Commands

### Development

- `composer dev` — Starts Laravel server, queue worker, log monitoring (Pail), and Vite dev server concurrently
- `composer transform-types` — Manually regenerates TypeScript types from PHP Data and Enums

### Code Quality

- `composer lint` — Runs Rector (refactoring), Pint (PHP formatting), and Vite Plus (JS/TS/Vue linting and formatting)
- `composer test:lint` — Dry-run mode for CI/CD pipelines

### Testing

- `composer test:type-coverage` — Ensures 100% type coverage with Pest
- `composer test:types` — Runs PHPStan (level max) and TypeScript (`tsc --noEmit`) type checking
- `composer test:unit` — Runs Pest tests with 100% code coverage requirement
- `composer test` — Runs the complete suite (type coverage, unit tests, linting, static analysis)

### Maintenance

- `composer update:requirements` — Updates all PHP and NPM dependencies to latest versions

## Code Style

This project enforces a strict, automated code style across both PHP and JavaScript/TypeScript:

- **PHP:** Laravel Pint for formatting, Rector for automated refactoring and modernisation
- **JS/TS/Vue:** Vite Plus handles linting (oxlint) and formatting (oxfmt) via the `vp` CLI
- **Types:** 100% type coverage enforced on both PHP (PHPStan level max) and TypeScript (strict mode)

Run `composer lint` to auto-fix formatting across the entire codebase.

## Code Standards

- **Actions-Oriented Architecture:** Every operation is encapsulated in a single-action class
- **Cruddy by Design:** Standardised CRUD operations for all controllers, actions, and Inertia pages
- **Immutable-First:** Data structures favour immutability to prevent unexpected mutations
- **Fail-Fast:** Errors are caught at compile-time through strict static analysis, not at runtime
- **Strict Laravel Defaults:** Strict models, auto eager loading, immutable dates via [Essentials](https://github.com/nunomaduro/essentials)
- **AI Guidelines:** Integrated AI guidelines to assist in maintaining code quality and consistency

## Testing

The project uses [Pest](https://pestphp.com) with a comprehensive testing suite. The following standards are enforced:

- **100% code coverage** — the test suite will fail if coverage drops below 100%
- **100% type coverage** — every method, property, and parameter must be explicitly typed
- **Static analysis** — PHPStan at level max (maximum strictness)
- **Browser testing** — Pest browser tests powered by Playwright

Run the full suite with:

```bash
composer test
```

Or run individual checks:

```bash
composer test:unit            # Unit & feature tests
composer test:types           # PHPStan + TypeScript type checking
composer test:type-coverage   # Type coverage check
composer test:lint            # Linting dry-run
```
